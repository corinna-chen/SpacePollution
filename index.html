    <h1> Whatta Waste Of Space </h1>

    <h2> Our Mission and Hello! </h2>
    <p> Hi there! Our names are Corinna and Paola, and we built this conversational and hopefully semi-comedic website to highlight the importance of the environment! We decided to focus on space because space pollution is a topic that is out of this world üåé. People often only think about the environment on earth and in terms of climate change. We acknowledge the importance of sustainability, climate change, and VSCO girls, but we thought about what would happen if VSCO girls won't pull through-- which we know they will. Would we have to make our own trips to space üåå like Jeffrey Bezos, and if so, where would we go? Well, we got you guys covered; you're in safe hands üëä (or rockets üöÄ).</p> 

    <h2> What is space pollution? </h2>
    <p> Space pollution is well... pollution in space. Space pollution is also called space debris, space junk, space waste, space trash, or space garbage -- the list goes on and on. Space pollution is artificial objects in space, which no longer serve a useful function.</p>

    <h2> What is the problem? </h2>
    <p> Well, let's begin with where most space pollution is. 23,000 fragments of space pollution sit within 1,250 miles of the Earth's surface in what is known as low Earth orbit, home to many satellites. 23,000 doesn't sound like a lot of space pollution because there is lots of space in space (who would have thought). However, space pollution is mighty fast, like very very fast. Space junk can collide with other objects at over 22,300 mph. To reference, bullets travel at 1,800 mph, and rockets must travel at 17,000 mph to go from the Earth to Earth's low orbit. Space pollution often hits satellites, telescopes, and other space objects leaving holes and pits, which can disrupt a mission and create more space junk.</p>

    <p> When looking at the big picture, there are more than 3,000 dead satellites and rocket stages currently floating in space and up to 900,000 pieces of space junk ranging from 1 to 10 centimeters in size. All large enough to be a collision hazard. </p>

    <p> To make a earthie analogy, space junk are uncontrollable bullets that so happen to be flying around and humans are on the move but can't outrun the bullets. </p>

    <h2> Are there any solutions? </h2>
    <p> According to a new study, the most effective way to solve the space junk problem is not to get space pollution out of space but to create an international agreement to charge operators ‚Äúorbital-use fees‚Äù for every satellite put into orbit. Economist Matthew Burgess claims orbital use fees would increase the long-run value of the space industry. By reducing future satellite and pollution collision risk, an annual fee rising to about $235,000 per satellite would quadruple the value of the satellite industry by 2040. However, this solution seems to diverge the need to address space pollution by focusing on the economic needs of space. Having people pay money to launch potentially more space pollution will not fix the problem at hand.</p>

    <p> The rest of google proposes using technology to remove space pollution from orbit with nets, harpoons, or lasers and deorbiting a satellite at the end of its life as opposed to leaving it in space, creating more space junk. However, this doesn't create an incentive for operators to be mindful of the impact they are making on earth and in space. </p>

    <p> There is no universally recognized solution to the problem. So solutions are being presented, but action hasn't been taken. Hopefully, you'll have one to save the universe!</p>

    <h2> BUt WhAt aBoUT tHe EaRTh? </h2>
    <p> Space pollution does affect the earth! Space pollution affects weather satellites that report the weather to us earthies! We decided not to base our focus on the earth's environmental needs because we felt that there were a ton of websites that have address the issue Talks about climate change being irreversible got us thinking about solutions that are out of this world (or box).</p>
