    <h1> Frequently Asked Questions! </h1>

    <button class="accordion">How and when did space pollution start?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>It all started during the war where Russia and the US had to prove who was superior, also known as the Cold War AKA the war with the space race. The space race gave us the first human-made satellite and the first piece of space pollution, Sputnik 1 on October 4, 1957.</p>

    <button class="accordion">How does space pollution get there?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Space pollution is a result of sending satellites, rockets, rovers, or anything we launch into space that is no longer functions/serves a purpose. How it gets into space is rocket science ðŸš€ðŸ§ª. </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Whats the worst that can happen?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Well, if you're in space, space junk can collide into your space vehicle! As rare as it is, you can also get hit with space junk on earth! Although most of it burns up in the atmosphere, larger objects can reach the ground intact. According to NASA, an average of one cataloged piece of debris has fallen back to Earth each day for the past 50 years. Don't worry! Despite their size, there has been no significant property damage from the debris. In addition, no one has been killed by space junk... yet and hopefully ever.</p>

    <button class="accordion">Has anyone been hit with space junk?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Yeah :( In 1969, five sailors on a Japanese ship were injured when space debris from what was believed to be a Soviet spacecraft struck the deck of their boat. In 1997 falling space debris from the Delta II rocket hit Oklahoman Lottie Williams.</p>

    <button class="accordion">Is space pollution on other planets?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Unfortunately yes. Mars has space pollution as they have 8 unresponsive satellites. Jupiter's massive gravitation pull, well... pulls in space pollution.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What happens if we don't remove space pollution?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>This is a very hypothetical question as we haven't done much to remove space pollution yet. Our best guess is that it will make space exploration harder and interfere with the space station and satellites.</p>
