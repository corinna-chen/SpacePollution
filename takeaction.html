    <h1> What can I do to prevent space junk? </h1>
    <p> We wish we had the power to ask Elon Musk to fly us to space, so we can swim around collecting trash or set up a large net to catch space pollution. It seems that there isn't an everyday activity we could do to prevent space pollution. We know this answer can be disappointing but keep in mind that you aren't launching a satellite into space (as far as we know).</p>

    <h2> Let's get Serious </h2>
    <p> There needs to be more we can do to address space pollution. Better yet, organizations and companies that are sending what turns into space pollution also need to step up and solve the issue they are contributing to. While there is nothing you can directly do, you can attempt to get involved with companies that seek to retrieve space junk. Feel free to get in contact with them if you're interested! Always remember, you never know until you try!!!</p>

    <p> <a href = "https://clearspace.today/" class = 'org'> ClearSpace – Man-Made Space Debris Removal: </a> ClearSpace develops technologies to remove unresponsive satellites from space. ClearSpace One, the startup’s small satellite solution, finds, captures, and remove man-made space debris. As for an expected timeframe, the startup plans to remove the first pieces of debris from space by 2025. </p>
    <p> <a href = "https://www.sharemyspace.space/" class = 'org'> Share My Space – Collision Warning & Debris Monitoring: </a> French startup Share My Space offers a collision warning service based on astronomy observations and deep learning algorithms. First,they predict the risk related to on-orbit collisions. Second, they enable satellite operators to respond to collision warning messages automatically. Third they help with systematic on-orbit space debris collection based on bio-mimicry. Share My Space systems integrate heterogeneous data sources coming from multiple detection technologies, such as lasers mounted on telescopes, to improve the accuracy of debris monitoring.</p>
    <p> <a href = "https://www.obruta.com/" class = 'org'> Obruta – Tethered-Net Removal Technology: </a>  Obruta meets the growing concerns around the safety, removal, and future mitigation of all space debris. The startup tackles the immediate threat of space debris through active tethered-net removal technology and end-of-life deployable deorbiting systems. To enable humans to occupy space in a sustainable manner, Obruta is developing the Puck, a device to end the single-use paradigm of spacecraft. By enabling refueling amongst other features, the Puck allows all satellites to extend their lifespans while aiding in their eventual removal. </p>

    <h2> Here are alternatives! </h2>
    <p> While you can't clean up space junk like you can a beach, you can make sure that we never have to run into space junk! By reducing your carbon footprint on the earth, you can help ensure we never have to shoot ourselves into space (and space pollution)! This is the part where we give you the cliche recycle, use reusables, etc. In all seriousness, channel your inner VSCO girl! Use that reusable bottle and bag, cut down on your meat intake, the list goes on and on. Now you don't need to be the perfect zero waste girl on Instagram. We ask is that you try your best to be eco-friendly because, at the end of the day, that's all you can do, give sustainability your best shot. </p>
