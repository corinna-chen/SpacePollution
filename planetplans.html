        <p> Mercury is super hot or super cold! You'll get sick of the heat during the day and sick of the cold at night. A day on Mercury lasts about 176 earth days so you have time to enjoy (or complain) about the fridged or boiling weather. Mercury has lots of craters, which translates into a lots of rolled ankles. There is also no proof of life on Mercury so you will either be the first or... welp that got dark. In conclusion, if you have strong ankles, like the extreme, and are a risk taker Mercury may be right for you! </p>

        <p> Venus is very hot and dry (like the cute men on netflix shows). Water is nonexistent on Venus, if you imported water from earth it will boil before you can drink it. Hopefully by the time you read this you have resuable materials that can resist up to 462 degrees celsius. The air pressure is also 90 times greater than the air pressure on earth so don't get squished! Venus sounds impossible in the year 2021 but one day technology may be advance enough to stand Venus's harsh environment.</p>

        <p> Oh Earth... you had your moment. You were once the star (or really planet) of the show. You are still habitable but insanely hot. However, you want to get out of Earth because it's outdated (maybe one day we can call earth vintage). However, the possibility to move out of earth gets smaller and smaller. Blasting out of Earth becomes more of a game of, "Will my rocket get hit by space pollution and become more space pollution?" Let's keep searching, time is precious! </p>

        <p> We have all heard the, "there was once life on Mars," argument but is it true? Nope, you were lied to (I know it hurts â˜¹ ). There is no proof of past or present life on Mars. There is evidence suggesting that the surface environment of Mars had liquid water and may have been habitable for microorganisms during the ancient Noachian period. While some microbes from Earth can survive on Mars, it doesn't suggest humans can. The radiation, reduced air pressure, and an atmosphere with only 0.16% oxygen makes it close to impossible to live on Mars. Space pollution also poses an issue on Mars! Eight out of 14 orbiting objects in Martian orbit are inactive, which makes more than half of the population around Mars space pollution. Additionally, as rovers and more technology land on Mars, more space pollution will live on Mars. Space pollution on Mars could worsen to the point where it would be difficult to enter or exit the planet without colliding with space pollution.</p>

        <p> Jupiter is the most complicated planet, but it pulls through. While the conditions on Jupiter make it close to impossible to live on, Jupiter's surroundings have potential. For instance, Jupiters moon Europa, where it is likely that a vast ocean lies beneath its icy crust, where life could possibly be supported. If you imported heat to Europa, you would have a new home! A bonus to living near Jupiter is it rains diamonds! Go get that bag ðŸ’°!!!</p>
