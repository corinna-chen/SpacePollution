# SpacePollution

## Created by:
Corinna and Paola at Sego Lily Hacks

## Inspiration
We were inspired by the phrase think outside the box. We wanted to focus on the environment beyond the earth, and that's how we had the idea to make a website on space pollution. We wanted to create a website that had a light and funny tone because websites about the climate tend to be very serious and not captivating.
